# 2024ElectionSimulator

This project is a basic implementation of simulating election outcomes of the 2024 Presidential Election in Java. It will be based on current predictions of the election from statistical modeling of the election from FiveThirtyEight and The Economist. My model will also account for a random element. This random element can account for oversampling of Democrats or Republicans in current polling, as well as new developments that could affect the outcome of the election, but not drastically. It will estimate Biden and Trump's probability of winning the election.
